1. Initialize the Application
• Start the Tkinter application.
• Set the title, size, and background color of the main window.
2. Create Input Field
• Create an input field (Entry widget) to display the current equation.
3. Create Buttons
• Define buttons for numbers (0-9), operations (+, -, *, /), and 
special functions (AC, (, ), X^2, X^3, √, 1/X, %, =).
• Assign each button a specific command/function to execute when 
clicked.
4. Define Functions
• show(value):
• Append the clicked button's value to the current equation.
• Handle special operations (X^2, X^3, √, 1/X) by appending 
the appropriate mathematical representation.
• clear():
• Clear the current equation.
• solve():
• Evaluate the current equation using eval() and display the 
result.
5. Main Loop
• Start the Tkinter main loop to keep the application running.
